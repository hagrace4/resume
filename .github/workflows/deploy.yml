# GitHub Actions Workflow for Resume Application CI/CD
# This workflow automatically builds, tests, and deploys the resume app to Oracle Cloud

# Workflow name - appears in GitHub Actions UI
name: Deploy Resume Application

# TRIGGERS: Define when this workflow runs
on:
  # Trigger 1: Automatic - runs when code is pushed to main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  
  # Trigger 2: Manual - adds a "Run workflow" button in GitHub UI
  # This lets you deploy on-demand without pushing code

        description: 'Git reference to deploy (branch, tag, or commit SHA)'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

        run: pnpm build
      
      # Step 6: Run code quality checks
